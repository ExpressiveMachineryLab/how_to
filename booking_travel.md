# How to book travel

We travel a lot, and booking travel can be expensive. There are two options for booking travel, in order of expediency.

## 1. Book travel through Michael Terrell.

Send *all of the following information* to Michael via Slack (`@michael.terrell`):

1. Your full name as it appears on your passport or government ID
2. Your date of birth (MM/DD/YYYY)
3. Your email address
4. Your mobile phone number
5. The project number the travel should be charged to
6. Where you are going, and the days of travel
7. A link to your flight. Search [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights/), find what you need, and send him that link.

## 2. Book your travel yourself and get reimbursed.

This is expedient, but you can't be reimbursed until after travel. For claiming expenses, see the Expenses page in this repo.
