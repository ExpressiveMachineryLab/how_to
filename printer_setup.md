# How to set up a printer on your laptop

## Please note: To use the printer you must be connected to `GTWifi`. If you have problems, first check that you're not connected to Eduroam!

These instructions are for setting up printing to the printer in the lab hallway. These instructions are for Mac OS X.

## 1. Find your printer settings and add a new printer.
- Open up your System Preferences, and click on Printers & Scanners.
- On the resulting popup, find the list of printers on the left. These are the printers you already have set up.
- Click the little `+` button at the bottom of the list to add a new printer.

## 2. Input your new printer settings.
In the top half of the popup: 
- On the resulting popup, click 'IP' in the top tabs.
- Put this in the `Address` field: 143.215.199.209
- In the `Protocol` dropdown, choose `Line Printer Daemon - LPD`

In the bottom half of the popup:
- Under `Name`, call it something you'll recognise (like `That printer in the hallway`, for example).
- Leave `Location` blank.
- For the third field, you need to check if you have drivers, and if you don't you might have to download them. Go to the next step.

## 3. Check for drivers.

- Check if you need to download the drivers by choosing `Select software ...` from the `User:` dropdown.
- In the searchbox at the top of the popup, type `mx-`. If you have the drivers installed, you'll get some results. Choose `Sharp MX-4111N`. Go to Step 4.

If you don't get any search results, you'll need to download and install the drivers. To find the right drivers:
- [Go to this link on Sharpusa.com](http://siica.sharpusa.com/product-downloads?_ga=2.248254343.1225520772.1528998886-517572212.1528998886).
- You'll have to specify the `Product category`, `Product` and `File type` that you're looking for using the drop downs. Use these:
   - `Product category:` MFPs
   - `Product:` MX-4111N
   - `File type:` Drivers and utilities
- Click `Search`, and choose the `MAC OS Driver Package`. It will download automatically.

Now, install your drivers:
- Double click the downloaded zip file to unzip it.
- Inside there is a .dmg file. Double click it.
- Inside there is a MacOSX folder. Double click it.
- Choose your version of Mac OS (if you're not sure, go to the Apple logo in the upper left corner of your screen, and click `About This Mac`. This will tell you what version you're running.)
- Inside the folder for your version number, double click on the installer package to start installation. This will take no time at all.

## 4. Use the printer.

Print any document. Choose the printer (you'll recognise it in the list from the name you chose earlier). Print your document. Enjoy.
