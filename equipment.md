# Borrowing equipment

Our lab is very fortunate to have a lot of equipment for research, testing, and experimentation. 

This equipment can be borrowed by students at any time. However, we need to keep track of these resources by following the protocol below. *Please note that you are responsible for what you borrow while it's in your possession, and you are responsible for its safe return.*

## 1. Determine what you need.

You can check what we have in two ways:
- [Peruse the lab inventory sheet](#)
- Come in to the lab and have a look. Ask a PhD student for cupboard keys.

## 2. Sign it out.

Access the [lab equipment sign-out doc](#) and provide:

- Your name
- Your email
- Your student number
- The date you signed it out
- When you intend to return it

## 3. Return what you borrowed.

1. Bring the gear back to the lab and put it back in the cupboard. 
2. Access the [lab equipment sign-out doc](#) and note the date the gear was returned.
