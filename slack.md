# All about Slack

This lab relies heavily on Slack. Our general Slack channel is here:

# [https://adamlab.slack.com/](https://adamlab.slack.com/)

(We also have a private group for active research. You'll be added to this if necessary, but ask your team lead.)

A few things to know about Slack:

## 1. This is the best place to contact people.

Brian Magerko (`@magerko') and Michael Terrell (`@michael.terrell`) use Slack as a primary method of communication. 

If you're part of the lab, you're expected to keep an eye on Slack during lab hours. This is so issues don't get lost in the shuffle of email, and so all communication is centralised.

## 2. Slack is available for your phone.

If you're a permanent lab member (GRA, Tech Temp, PhD student, undergraduate researcher, etc) we *strongly recommend* installing Slack on your phone so you get timely alerts about things that need your attention.
